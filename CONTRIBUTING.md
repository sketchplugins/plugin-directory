# Contributing

To add a new plugin to the directory:

1. Fork the repo (create a new branch as well if you want)
1. Modify `plugins.json` by adding your plugin (do not edit `README.md`, it will be automatically generated once your change is merged)
1. Push your changes to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/sketchplugins/plugin-directory/compare/)

Thanks in advance!
