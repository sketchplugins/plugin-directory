# Contributing

To add a new plugin to the directory:

1. Fork the repo (create a new branch as well if you want)
2. Modify `plugins.json` by adding your plugin
3. Run `rake` to update the `README.md` file
4. Push your changes to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/sketchplugins/plugin-directory/compare/)

Thanks in advance!
